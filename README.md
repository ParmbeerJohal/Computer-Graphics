# Computer-Graphics

## Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes
This course provides an introduction to the field of computer graphics and computer-based image synthesis, including all its three main sub-topics: Modelling, Rendering and Animation. We will cover the basic theoretical concepts, such as color spaces, light-geometry interaction, graphics data structures, spatial transformation and key-frame interpolation. We will also investigate how these fundamental components are integrated in current graphics platforms and implement simple graphics programs in the Unity game framework. Students will experiment with modern graphics programming and build small programs in Unity and C#.
